# V1 Rollout Master Plan: 1M+ User Sovereign Mesh

**Status:** Updated Analysis for 1M+ Scale & Sovereignty  
**Date:** 2026-01-12 (Updated with Phase 4 Completion)  
**Latest Achievement:** ✅ Sneakernet Message Relay Implementation Complete

## 🚨 Critical Strategy: The Path to 1 Million Users

To achieve a **1,000,000+ user rollout** with **complete P2P mesh sovereignty**, development must shift focus from basic connectivity to **Scalability (DHT)** and **Hardened Security**.

The following analysis is based on the active GitHub Issues Phases 1-10.

### 🛑 Top 5 Critical Blockers (Immediate Action Required)

These issues are the absolute bottlenecks for a sovereign, scalable network.

1.  **#130: Peer Discovery & Bootstrapping Without Central Servers**
    - **Why:** You cannot have sovereignty if you depend on a central bootnode. This is the definition of "Mesh Sovereignty".
    - _Related:_ #65 (Bootstrap Landing)

2.  **#128: Fix core/ integration across all platforms**
    - **Why:** Maintaining three separate network stacks (JS, Kotlin, Swift) is impossible at 1M scale. Protocol divergence will split the mesh.
    - _Related:_ #112 (Android Core), #114 (iOS Core), #107 (Transport Abstraction)

3.  **#129: Encrypt All Local Storage (Web, Android, iOS)**
    - **Why:** Sovereignty implies user ownership. Unencrypted data on-device is a liability.
    - _Related:_ #111 (Web DB), #115 (iOS Keychain), #135 (Startup Encryption)

4.  **Phase 7: Scaling Without Hierarchy (DHT Implementation)**
    - **Issues:** #170, #171, #172, #180 (Platform DHT)
    - **Why:** Gossip protocols (flood fill) die at ~1k-10k nodes. Reaching 1M+ users **requires** a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for O(log N) routing. This is the **Scalability** unlock.

5.  **Phase 6: Privacy & Security (Zero-Trust)**
    - **Issues:** #167, #168 (Privacy Routing), #169
    - **Why:** In a 1M+ node mesh, "friends of friends" trust breaks down. You need anonymous/blind routing (e.g., Kademlia with privacy extensions) to protect metadata.

## 🗺️ Phased Rollout Roadmap

The following phases (derived from Issues #155-#180) outline the execution path.

### Phase 1-3: Foundation & Resilience (Current Focus)

_Goal: A working mesh that survives offline & spotty networks._

- **Phase 2: Hop-Based Intelligent Routing** (#155 - #157)
  - _Focus:_ Fluid relays, dynamic paths.
- **Phase 3: Opportunistic Transport** (#158 - #160)
  - _Focus:_ Multi-transport (BLE/Wifi/WebRTC), Bandwidth optimization.
  - _Scale:_ Works for local clusters (campus/city blocks).

### Phase 4-6: Sovereignty & Privacy (The "Sovereign" Layer)

_Goal: The network becomes unkillable and private._

- **Phase 4: Sneakernet / Offline** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - ✅ Persistent message storage implemented
  - ✅ Sneakernet routing through any available peer
  - ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff (10-second intervals)
  - ✅ Message persistence across network changes and disconnections
  - ✅ Route tracking prevents duplicate attempts
  - ✅ Zero message loss guarantee
- **Phase 5: Device Reputation** (#164 - #166)
  - _Critical:_ Prevents spam/bad actors in a public mesh.
- **Phase 6: Privacy & Security** (#167 - #169)
  - **PREREQUISITE FOR 1M USERS**: You cannot expose user IPs/IDs to 1M strangers.

### Phase 7-10: Hyper-Scale (The "1M+" Layer)

_Goal: Global scale without central servers._

- **Phase 7: DHT & Scaling** (#170 - #172)
  - _Tech:_ Kademlia or similar DHT.
- **Phase 8: Monitoring** (#174 - #176)
- **Phase 9: Validation** (#177 - #179)
- **Phase 10: Platform-Specific DHT** (#180)
